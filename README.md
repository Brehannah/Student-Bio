# Student-Bio
My name is Breana Hannah, I attend a full stack development program at Georgia Technical College. I am
expanding my skills on daily basis. This program has opened my eyes to the beauty of technology. I have plenty
to learn and I am eager to learn it. I am currently located in Richmond Hill Georgia as I earn my Bachlors Degree. 
I have a feeling that the aspect of learning will never end for me. I love the thrill of exploring new topics and 
events. I sky drive when the time presents itself. Going to the beach is always my go to on a warm sunny day. I 
consider myself an outgoing individual. My motivation for my consistent go-getter spirit is definitely my family 
and the vision that I have for a bright future.
